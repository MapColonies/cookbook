#### Overview

Optimal, complete, easy, efficient, and robust solution for raster product consumption is now available. Just start by querying the catalog for the desired product and set your map component up in no time.

#### Catalog Service

You are now able to search, and filter all the available raster products in your cloud environment via CSW protocol. Refer to the profile of the raster records [here](/docs/MapColonies/Raster/services/catalog/raster-catalog-profile-v1)

#### Tile Serving Service (“Map Server”)

You are now able to consume raster tiles via the tile serving service in the WMTS protocol. Check [here](/docs/MapColonies/Raster/Guides/raster-getting-started) for a step-by-step tutorial.

#### Known Bugs 🐞

GetCapabilities shows the wrong extent of the layer.

There is up to 5 minutes delay between a layer presented in the catalog to be available for consumption via the tile server.
