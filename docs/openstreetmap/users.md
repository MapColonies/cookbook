# OpenStreetMap Users <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
A list of various OpenStreetMap users taken from Wikipedia.

- ***Amazon*** uses OpenStreetMap for navigation and has a team who revises the map based on feedback from drivers.
- ***Apple Inc.*** unexpectedly created an OpenStreetMap-based map for iPhoto for iOS on 7 March 2012, and launched the maps without properly citing the data source – though this was corrected in 1.0.1. OpenStreetMap is one of the many cited sources for Apple's custom maps in iOS 6, though the majority of map data is provided by TomTom. As of February 2021, Apple was the most prolific corporate editor, responsible for 80% of edits to existing roads.
- ***Ballardia*** (games developer) launched World of the Living Dead: Resurrection in October 2013, which has incorporated OpenStreetMap into its game engine, along with census information, to create a browser-based game mapping over 14,000 square kilometres of greater Los Angeles and survival strategy gameplay. Its previous incarnation had used Google Maps, which had proven incapable of supporting high volumes of players, so during 2013 they shut down the Google Maps version and ported the game to OpenStreetMap.
- ***Craigslist*** switched to OpenStreetMap in 2012, rendering their own tiles based on the data.
- ***Facebook*** uses the map directly in its website/mobile app (depending on the zoom level, the area and the device), with a rendering style designed by Stamen Design as of 2021. Facebook has also used AI technology to detect roads absent from OpenStreetMap but visible in aerial imagery ("mapwith.ai" / "Map with AI"), and has developed an OpenStreetMap editing tool ("RapiD") for adding these roads to OpenStreetMap. The "Daylight Map Distribution" is a snapshot of OpenStreetMap data created by Facebook that claims to be clean of vandalism.
- ***Flickr*** uses OpenStreetMap data for various cities around the world, including Baghdad, Beijing, Kabul, Santiago, Sydney and Tokyo. In 2012, the maps switched to use Nokia data primarily, with OpenStreetMap being used in areas where the commercial provider lacked performance.
- ***Foursquare*** started using OpenStreetMap via Mapbox's rendering and infrastructure of OpenStreetMap.
- ***Garmin*** uses OpenStreetMap data for some maps for GPSs units.
- ***Geotab*** uses OpenStreetMap data in their Vehicle Tracking Software platform, MyGeotab.
- Hasbro, the toy company behind the real estate-themed board game Monopoly, launched Monopoly City Streets, a massively multiplayer online game (MMORPG) which allowed players to "buy" streets all over the world. The game used map tiles from Google Maps and the Google Maps API to display the game board, but the underlying street data was obtained from OpenStreetMap. The online game was a limited time offering, its servers were shut down in the end of January 2010.
- ***Komoot***, a route planning service for running, cycling and hiking uses OpenStreetMap data
- ***Mapbox***, a provider of custom online maps for websites and applications
- ***MapQuest*** announced a service based on OpenStreetMap in 2010, which eventually became MapQuest Open.
- ***Mapy.cz*** is based on OpenStreetMap and extends it by allowing users to upload photos, by making web searches by categories like travel tips, restaurant, accommodation, and by featuring 3D views, areal views, historical photos and haptic mode for blind people. It has apps for both Android and iOS with offline maps.
- ***Moovit*** uses maps based on OpenStreetMap in their free mobile application for public transit navigation.
- ***Niantic*** switched to OpenStreetMap based maps from Google Maps on 1 December 2017 for their games Ingress and Pokémon Go.
- ***Nominatim*** (from the Latin, 'by name') is a tool to search OpenStreetMap data by name and address (geocoding) and then to generate synthetic addresses of OpenStreetMap points (reverse geocoding).
- ***OpenTopoMap*** renders topographic maps based on OpenStreetMap data and on SRTM data.
- ***Petal Maps*** is a free mobile map application developed by Huawei. From its copyright statement, OpenStreetMap is one of their map data sources.
- ***Snapchat's*** June 2017 update introduced its Snap Map with data from Mapbox, OpenStreetMap, and DigitalGlobe.
- ***Strava*** switched to OpenStreetMap rendered and hosted by Mapbox from Google Maps in July 2015.
- ***Tableau*** has integrated OpenStreetMap for all their mapping needs. It has been integrated in all of their products.
- ***TCDD Taşımacılık*** uses OpenStreetMap as a location map on passenger seats on YHTs.
- ***Tesla*** Smart Summon feature released widely in US in October 2019 uses OSM data to navigate vehicles in private parking areas autonomously (without a safety driver)
- ***Wahoo*** uses OpenStreetMap for mapping and giving turn-by-turn navigation in their ELEMNT cycling computers.
- ***Webots*** uses OpenStreetMap data to create a virtual environment for autonomous vehicle simulations.
- ***Gurtam*** uses OpenStreetMap data in their GPS Tracking Software platform, Wialon.
- ***Wikimedia*** projects uses OpenStreetMap as a locator map for cities and travel points of interest.
- ***Wikipedia*** uses OpenStreetMap data to render custom maps used by the articles. Many languages are included in the WIWOSM project (Wikipedia Where in OpenStreetMap) which aims to show OpenStreetMap objects on a slippy map, directly visible on the article page.
