#### Tile Serving (“Map Server”)
#### General features
Caching and monitoring improvements.

#### Ingestion Service (activated via Catalog App in manager mode)
1. A full ingestion solution was added for new products for new materials with various raw data formats (`j2k`, `tiff`, `GPKG`).

* Overall improvements in serving 3D tiles.

#### Overview

Optimal, complete, easy, efficient, and robust solution for raster product consumption is now available. Just start by querying the catalog for the desired product and set your map component up in no time.

#### Catalog Service

You are now able to search, and filter all the available 3D photorealistic models in your cloud environment via CSW protocol. Refer to the profile of the 3D records [here](/catalog-information/v2_0/3D_profile)


#### Tile Serving Service

You are now able to consume 3D tiles (b3dm) via the tile serving service in a tile layer (“XYZ”) protocol. Check [here](/getting-started/3D/3D_step-by-step) for a step-by-step tutorial.



### Vector
