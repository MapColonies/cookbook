# Best Practices

## Application Startup

When your application is loaded or refreshed it is recommended that you make a request to our `catalogue` services in order to fetch **up-to-date information**. Caching the request may result in errors due to changed metadata and links, new items or even deleted items that don't exist anymore.

## Catalog items

In order to use our services you are required to go through the catalogue. The `catalogue` is the gatewat to many of our services, it details the available `items` and `item metadata` for a particular domain.

## Hardcoded Links

:::warning
We hold the right to change any link that is available through our catalogue services at any time.
:::

We require that you fetch and extract any link that is available in our `catalogue services` through your code.<br/>
Any link that **isn't available** through the catalogue service may be held as an **easily configureable** parameter.

## Basemaps

At application startup there is usually a set of default Raster layers that are displayed. The `productId` and `productType` for each layer should be held as an **easily configureable** list of parameters in case you want to use different layers in the future.

We also recommend the layers are loaded in the same order as described in the list for easy swapping.

## Pagination

Some of our services return multiple results per request according to filter paremeters, and due to geographic entities the returned payload may be very large. In order to solve this issue we implement `pagination` using special parameters.

We recommend using `pagination` in order to control the amount of results returned and easily split our request in to multiple requests.
