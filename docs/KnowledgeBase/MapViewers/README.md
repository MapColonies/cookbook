There are so many map viewers out there, how do you choose the best one for your needs?
Here we attempt to help you make this decision.

Disclaimer:
Everything written in this knowledge base is based on our research of selected well known map viewers. We do not attempt to recommend one as the best, but give you all the information we believe you need in order to make a better decision based on your use case.
Some of the viewers may be incompatible with some of our data or services and will require additional adjustments in order to consume them (for some it may not be possible at all).

So lets get started!

## What is a map viewer / component?

A map viewer is a visual component to help us display `geographic` data such as raster, vector, 3D and DEM. It does all of the heavy-lifting in fetching, calculating and displaying the data correctly.

There are many features that a map viewer could implement, please read more about the different libraries and features [here](/docs/KnowledgeBase/MapViewers/map-components.md).
