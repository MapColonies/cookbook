# Export Service üì¶

## Purpose
The export service is responsible for packaging mapping data that can be downloaded by clients or transferred to other systems. Export can be requested for various mapping products within a specific region. The export module exposes an API and Web-based tool.

## Usage
You can create export tasks via the Exporter-Trigger service API.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Authentication must be integrated in order to communicate with export service.**<br/>
> **See the principles [here](/getting-started/raster/raster_authentication.md)**

You can see the full OpenAPI spec [here](<RASTER-EXPORT-SERVICE_URL>/docs/api)

The API consists of several methods:
1. create (deprecated) - you can create a new export task, if the requested task params were previously created they are returned in the response, else via provided webhook
<div style="background:#ffedcc;padding:12px;line-height:24px;margin-bottom:24px">
  <p style="background:#f0b37e;font-weight: bold;display: block;color: #fff;margin: -12px;padding: 6px 12px;margin-bottom: 12px;">‚ö†Ô∏è "Deprecation warning"</p>
  <p style="color:#404040">The create API is in use of GetMap. This use is now deprecated. Use create/roi</a> instead.</p>
</div>
2. create/roi - you can create a new export task from ROI (region of intreset - GoeJson FeatureCollection), if the requested task params were previously created they are returned in the response, else via provided webhook
3. taskStatus/{jobId} - Get status (and percentage) by the id that is returned from the create method
4. storage - returns free and total existing size on export service storage

## Files structure

#### GPKG
SQLite DB file that contains all the necessary tiles
for more details view:
- **http://www.geopackage.org/spec/**
- **https://www.sqlite.org/index.html**

Our specification consists of the following:
- terms [here](/getting-started/raster/raster_must_know_terms?id=Terms)
- tiling scheme (World CRS84 TileMatrixSet) [here](/getting-started/raster/raster_must_know_terms?id=raster-tiling-scheme-in-detail)
- file extension: ".gpkg"

#### Metadata
JSON file that contains the record metadata such as footprint and resolution
- file extension: ".JSON"
- provided fields follow the profile convention [here](/catalog-information/v1_0/raster_profile)
**Note:** when using create/roi API the metadata link is returned via "links" response, while in create (deprecated) API the metadata can be reached only when replacing the GPKG link suffix from ".GPKG" to ".JSON"

### Important Notes
1. The data is returned via callback request or on /create request response (structure in appendix 1)
2. To download the data one needs to use authentication token

### Appendix 1 - Callback request structure (create/roi)
    - status: Enum - OperationStatus.IN_PROGRESS | OperationStatus.COMPLETED | OperationStatus.FAILED
    - links: Object - consist of download links for the exported GPKG and metadata file
    - expirationTime: string($date) - date when the exported file will be deleted
    - fileSize: number - GPKG file size in bytes
    - recordCatalogId: uuid - Raster Catalog Record DB ID - from orginal request
    - description: string - the description that was sent to the create method
    - roi: FeatureCollection - requested region of intrest
    - jobId: uuid - unique identifier for export request - the field that was returned from orginal create request
    - errorReason: string - if export task was unsuccessful this field will describe the error
