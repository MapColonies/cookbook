# Export Service üì¶

## Purpose
The export service is responsible for packaging mapping data that can be downloaded by clients or transferred to other systems. Export can be requested for various mapping products within a specific region. The export module exposes an API and Web-based tool.

## Usage
You can create export tasks via the Exporter-Trigger service API.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Authentication must be integrated in order to communicate with export service.**<br/>
> **See the principles [here](/getting-started/raster/raster_authentication.md)**

You can see the full OpenAPI spec [here](<RASTER-EXPORT-SERVICE_URL>/docs/api)

The API consists of one method:
1. create - you can create a new export task, if the requested task params were previously created they are returned in the response, else via provided webhook

## Files structure

#### GPKG
SQLite DB file that contains all the necessary tiles
for more details view:
- **http://www.geopackage.org/spec/**
- **https://www.sqlite.org/index.html**

Our specification consists of the following:
- terms [here](/getting-started/raster/raster_must_know_terms?id=Terms)
- tiling scheme (World CRS84 TileMatrixSet) [here](/getting-started/raster/raster_must_know_terms?id=raster-tiling-scheme-in-detail)
- file extension: ".gpkg"

#### Metadata
JSON file that contains the record metadata such as footprint and resolution
- file extension: ".JSON"
- provided fields follow the profile convention [here](/catalog-information/v1_0/raster_profile)



### Important Notes
1. The data is returned via callback response or on request response (structure in appendix 1)
2. To download the data one needs to use authentication token
3. To download the "metadta.json" file, write the GPKG url and change the sufix to ".json"


### Appendix 1 - Callback response structure
    - requestId: uuid - unique identifier for export request - the field that was returned from orginal create request
    - fileUri: string - download link for the exported GPKG file
    - expirationTime: string($date) - date when the exported file will be deleted
    - fileSize: number - GPKG file size in bytes
    - dbId: uuid - Raster Catalog Record DB ID - from orginal request
    - packageName: string - the GPKG file name
    - bbox: one of the following types (BBOX / GeoJson Geometry (Polygon / MultiPolygon), empty) - from orginal request
    - targetResolution - The target resolution in which the tiles will be created - (max DEGREE to PIXEL) - from orginal request
    - success: boolean - whether the export task was successfull
    - errorReason: string - if export task was unsuccessful this field will describe the error
