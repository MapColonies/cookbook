Welcome to the Map Colonies Wiki space.
Here you will find the technical documentation for the Map Colonies project. Enjoy!

## Introduction
The Map Colonies system is responsible for the management and serving of mapping products.
Mapping products can be originated from various sources and may include Orthophoto discrete layers, 3D models, DTM/DSM data, etc. The catalog holds the metadata of each product with references to the map content files. It enables management and the search of existing products.
The catalog exposes an API, as well as a Web UI.
