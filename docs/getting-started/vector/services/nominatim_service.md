# Nominatim

Nominatim (from the Latin, 'by name') is a tool to search OpenStreetMap data by name and address (geocoding) and to generate synthetic addresses of OSM points (reverse geocoding).

## How to use
Nominatim indexes named (or numbered) features within the OpenStreetMap (OSM) dataset and a subset of other unnamed features (pubs, hotels, churches, etc).

Its API has the following endpoints for querying the data:
 * __[/search](/osm/nominatim/nominatim_search.md)__ - search OSM objects by name or type
 * __[/reverse](/osm/nominatim/nominatim_reverse.md)__ - search OSM object by their location
 * __[/lookup](/osm/nominatim/nominatim_lookup.md)__ - look up address details for OSM objects by their ID

## Nominatim UI
Nominatim is a search API, it does not provide a website interface on its own. nominatim-ui offers a small website for trying Nominatim and inspecting the database content.
You can use the UI at the following address:[<VECTOR-NOMINATIM-UI_URL>](<VECTOR-NOMINATIM-UI_URL>)

## "I can't find my home address, do something about it ðŸ˜¡"
First, we are sorry, but its not our fault ðŸ¤·

We import the data as is from the internet, without any change or modification to maintain authenticity. Because OpenStreetMap is free and Open Source, you can go on their website at `openstreetmap.org`, and make the changes yourself. Be sure to read the guidelines before making any change to avoid it being removed.
